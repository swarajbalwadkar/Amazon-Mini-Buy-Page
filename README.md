# Amazon-Mini-Buy-Page
This project is a simple HTML and CSS-based webpage that mimics a miniature version of an Amazon product page. It features a product listing with a sample Nike Black Running Shoes item, including its price, stock status, and delivery information. Users can interact with the page through two buttons: Add to Cart and Buy Now.
