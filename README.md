# Amazon-Mini-Buy-Page

This project is one of my earliest works, created as part of my initial journey into web development. It reflects my early exploration of HTML and CSS concepts. 

This project is a simple HTML and CSS-based webpage that mimics a miniature version of an Amazon product page. It features a product listing with a sample Nike Black Running Shoes item, including its price, stock status, and delivery information. Users can interact with the page through two buttons: Add to Cart, which redirects to the Amazon cart page for this item, and Buy Now, which takes users to the Amazon purchase page for immediate checkout.
